If the design is in a pending situation and you run a command like "Create Sketch", a dialog appears asking if you want to capture the current position or not before continuing. This is because the creation of a sketch can be dependent on the current positions of occurrences in the design. Other commands, like "Fillet", depend directly on model geometry and do not rely on occurrence positions so running the Fillet command does not display the dialog and does not affect the pending state of the occurrences.<br/><br/> This property allows you to specify if your command is dependent on the current position of occurrences or not. One good way to know if your command is dependent or not is to run the commands in the UI that are equivalent to the API functions you're using and see if the dialog that prompts to save or abort appears. If it does, then you know your command is dependent on occurrence positions.<br/><br/> If this property is true, then the dialog will appear if there are any pending moved occurrences. The user can choose whether to capture the current changes or abort them, and then your command will continue.<br/><br/> If you set this property to false, (which is the default), then even if there are pending changes, the occurrences are left in their current positions and your command will run.</td>

<tr>
<td class="api-list"><a href="Command_preSelect.htm">preSelect</a></td>
<td class="api-list">This event is used to be able to participate in the selection process in a dynamic way. When a user is selecting geometry, they move the mouse over the model and if the entity the mouse is currently over is valid for selection it will highlight indicating that it can be selected. This process of determining what is available for selection and highlighting it is referred to as the "preselect" behavior.<br/><br/> You use functions on the SelectionCommandInput object to define what types of entities are selectable and in many cases this coarse level of specification is all that's needed, but in other cases you may need more control over the selection. For example, you might want to allow the user to selection construction planes and planar faces, which can easily be controlled by defining those as valid entities for selection in the SelectionCommandInput object. But if you only want to allow the user to select planes that are parallel then you need some dynamic control over the selection, which can be done using the preSelect event.<br/><br/> In the example of selecting parallel planes, you would still set the valid selection types for the SelectionCommandInput to allow selection of construction planes and planar faces. This will limit the selection to only planes but any plane can still be selected. You'll also need to connect to the preSelect event for the command. As the user moves the mouse over any construction plane or planar face, the preSelect event will fire for the plane the mouse is current over. If no planes have yet been selected, then you allow the user to select this plane. If one or more planes have already selected, then in the preSelect event you'll check to see if the plane the mouse is over is parallel to the first plane already selected. If it is then you allow it to be selected. If it isn't parallel then you set the isSelectable property of the provided SelectEventArgs object to False so that it won't pre-highlight and won't be selectable.<br/><br/> The entity and mouse position on the entity can be obtained through the Selection object returned through the selection property of the SelectionEventArgs object provided through the event.</td>

You can obtain the entity and mouse position from the Selection object returned by the selection property of the SelectionEventArgs object provided through the event.<br/><br/> Some related events are the preSelectMouseMove event, which fires as the mouse moves across the entity, and the preSelectEnd event, which fires when the mouse moves off the entity.</td>

For example, if you enter an invalid value for a ValueCommandInput, it can evaluate this on its own, and as a result, the validate inputs event is not fired. Fusion will sometimes fire this event at other random times that are not tied to the edit of an input.<br/><br/> If you want to be notified when an input changes, you should use the input changed event instead.</td>

If the design is in a pending situation and you run a command like "Create Sketch", a dialog appears asking if you want to capture the current position or not before continuing. This is because the creation of a sketch can be dependent on the current positions of occurrences in the design. Other commands, like "Fillet", depend directly on model geometry and do not rely on occurrence positions so running the Fillet command does not display the dialog and does not affect the pending state of the occurrences. This property allows you to specify if your command is dependent on the current position of occurrences or not. One good way to know if your command is dependent or not is to run the commands in the UI that are equivalent to the API functions you're using and see if the dialog that prompts to save or abort appears. If it does, then you know your command is dependent on occurrence positions. If this property is true, then the dialog will appear if there are any pending moved occurrences. The user can choose whether to capture the current changes or abort them, and then your command will continue. If you set this property to false, (which is the default), then even if there are pending changes, the occurrences are left in their current positions and your command will run.</p><pre class="api-code">"command_var" is a variable referencing a Command object.

When a user is selecting geometry, they move the mouse over the model and if the entity the mouse is currently over is valid for selection it will highlight indicating that it can be selected. This process of determining what is available for selection and highlighting it is referred to as the "preselect" behavior. You use functions on the SelectionCommandInput object to define what types of entities are selectable and in many cases this coarse level of specification is all that's needed, but in other cases you may need more control over the selection. For example, you might want to allow the user to selection construction planes and planar faces, which can easily be controlled by defining those as valid entities for selection in the SelectionCommandInput object. But if you only want to allow the user to select planes that are parallel then you need some dynamic control over the selection, which can be done using the preSelect event. In the example of selecting parallel planes, you would still set the valid selection types for the SelectionCommandInput to allow selection of construction planes and planar faces. This will limit the selection to only planes but any plane can still be selected. You'll also need to connect to the preSelect event for the command. As the user moves the mouse over any construction plane or planar face, the preSelect event will fire for the plane the mouse is current over. If no planes have yet been selected, then you allow the user to select this plane. If one or more planes have already selected, then in the preSelect event you'll check to see if the plane the mouse is over is parallel to the first plane already selected. If it is then you allow it to be selected. If it isn't parallel then you set the isSelectable property of the provided SelectEventArgs object to False so that it won't pre-highlight and won't be selectable. The entity and mouse position on the entity can be obtained through the Selection object returned through the selection property of the SelectionEventArgs object provided through the event.</p><pre class="api-code">--------- Required include files. ---------
